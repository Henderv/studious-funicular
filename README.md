<h1 align="center">AIR Issue Tracker and Discussion Forum</h1>


This project acts as an **issue tracker** for bugs and feature requests connected to the *AIR SDK and Runtime*.
It does not contain any source code.

---

Now that Harman has taken over AIR development, we need a new place to discuss and report problems and make sure they know what's relevant to the community! 
That's what this repository is all about.

There are two major parts to this repository:

- [Discussions](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions) : A discussion forum for questions, ideas and general chat;
- [Issues](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/issues) : An issue tracker to report real bugs with the AIR SDK;

Always go to the **discussion** section first and only report an **issue** if you are sure it is a bug and have a reproducable case.


## I found a bug in the runtime! What do do?!

First of all, use the search feature to find out if somebody already reported a similar issue.
Also have a look at the [discussions section](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions)!

### a) This issue was already reported

* Vote for that issue. To do that, click on the "Add your reaction" button at the top of the issue description and click on the :+1: symbol.
* If possible, provide additional information by adding a comment.

### b) This is a new issue

* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/issues/new/choose) in this repository.
* A template will pop up that will help you collect all necessary information.
* Only a problem that can be reproduced has a chance of being fixed! Thus, create a minimal sample and provide all the information needed to get it running.
* I can't stress this enough: the easier you make it for Harman to recreate the problem, the higher your chances of a fix!


## I've got a question I can't answer

* Do **not** open up a new issue. Instead,
* head over to the [discussions section](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions) and ask your question there.
